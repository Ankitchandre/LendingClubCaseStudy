## General Information

### Project Information

> The project involves utilizing data science techniques to analyze the Lending Club dataset and predict the likelihood of loan default.

### Project Background

> This company operates as the leading online loan marketplace, offering a wide range of financial products such as personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Utilizing a streamlined online platform, borrowers can easily access loans with competitive interest rates. However, similar to many other lending institutions, extending loans to individuals deemed 'risky' poses the greatest financial risk, resulting in what is known as credit loss. Credit loss refers to the monetary shortfall experienced by the lender when borrowers fail to repay their loans or abscond with the borrowed funds. Essentially, borrowers classified as 'charged-off' represent the segment of customers who have defaulted on their loans, resulting in significant losses for the lender.


### Project Statement

> Determine the driving factors for company loss which lead to the defaulted loans 

### Data Set

> Loan.csv file and data dictionary
